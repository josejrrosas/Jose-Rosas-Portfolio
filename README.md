  ## Description:
    This is my personal portfolio website. You will find several sections about me such as about who I am, 
    my work, ways to contact me, and my resume. As apart of the acceptance criteria I had to make it responsive
    and adaptable to different screen sizes. You will also find links to take you to the sections you are looking
    for in the navigation bar.
